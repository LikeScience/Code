# Machine Learning Homework

Here you can find the group homework I completed for the Machine Learning course I took outside my degree program.

Each folder contains the statement of the corresponding homework, the report with our solutions to the 'Pen-and-Paper' problems and a notebook with our solutions to the 'Programming' questions.

Here is a comprehensive list of the questions I solved (the remaining were solved by my groupmate):

* Homework 1 (Decision Trees & Model Evaluation):
  * Question 4 of Pen-and-Paper; (Histogram, discriminant rules)
  * Questions 1, 2 and 3 of Programming. (ANOVA, Decision Trees with different sample splits)

* Homework 2 (kNN & Bayesian models):
  * Questions 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Pen-and-Paper. (kNN with Hamming Distance, Bayesian classifiers)

* Homework 3 (Linear Regression & MLPs):
  * Question 4 of Pen-and-Paper; (Stochastic gradient descent of MLP)
  * Questions 5 and 6 of Programming. (Comparing Linear Regression model with MLP)

* Homework 4 (Clustering & PCA):
  * Questions 1, 2a and 2b of Pen-and-Paper. (EM Clustering, Silhouette)
